# Spawn of Noob

Welcome to **Spawn of Noob**, the ultimate playground for a budding indie game developer! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€ This repository is my personal journey into the thrilling world of game development, where Iâ€™m diving headfirst into the Godot game engine with all the grace of a rookie.

As a noob indie dev, Iâ€™m here to explore, experiment, and occasionally stumble my way through creating games. Expect a collection of experimental projects, quirky prototypes, and maybe a few "oops, that didnâ€™t work" moments.

## What to Expect

- **Godot Adventures:** My trials and tribulations with the Godot engine, from basic tutorials to wacky experiments.
- **Code Experiments:** Playful projects and prototypes showcasing my learning curve.
- **Game Dev Fails:** Humorous insights into my development mishaps and what Iâ€™ve learned from them.

Join me on this adventure of code, creativity, and occasional chaos as I turn my noobish dreams into game dev reality. Contributions, advice, and moral support are always welcome!

Letâ€™s spawn some fun!
